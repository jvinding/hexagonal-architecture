# Summary

A very simple app to demonstrate the Hexagonal Architecture (Ports & Adapters) pattern.

# Notes

1. This is just an example, package names, class names, etc are not necessarily following any kind of recommended pattern.
2. There are 4 branches that show an evolution of the app.
    1. 1-simple-hexagon - This is a very simple "pure" version of a Hexagonal app.
    2. 2-simple-with-use-cases - This one just adds "use cases" to the above app.
    3. 3-mediator - replace the primary port handler with a mediator pattern.
    3. 4-mediator-with-handlers - use a separate "handler" for each use case.
